During the challenging period of the COVID-19 pandemic, I took the initiative to create an online platform aimed at facilitating seamless access to our class recordings for the benefit of my classmates. This purpose-driven website serves as a centralized hub, offering a comprehensive collection of recorded class sessions, ensuring that valuable educational content remains easily accessible to all.
